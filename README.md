# Welcome to my humble abode
Hi, I’m @ZesTofthelemon. @llsc12 dragged me here by showing me the Codespace feature and I ended up having my interest in coding rekindled somehow.
I’m interested in a number of incredibly niche video game franchises, most notably Terraria, Enter the Gungeon, ADOFAI, ESCHATOS, TF2, DBFZ, the list goes on.
If I ever use this account it'll be to learn Java and/or make a Discord bot.
